# System Programming Assignments

This repository contains three assignments completed for a university-level **System Programming** course.  
All assignments are implemented in **C language**, focusing on low-level programming and operating system concepts.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Assignments Overview

### 1. Shell Implementation
- A basic shell that supports command execution, piping, redirection, and built-in commands.
- Demonstrates understanding of process creation (`fork`), execution (`exec`), and file descriptor manipulation.

### 2. Multi-threaded Socket Programming
- A simple client-server application built using **multi-threading and sockets**.
- The server can handle multiple clients concurrently using POSIX threads (`pthread`).
- Demonstrates understanding of TCP/IP communication and thread synchronization.

### 3. Custom `malloc` Implementation
- A custom memory allocator mimicking the behavior of the standard `malloc` function.
- Focuses on memory management, heap manipulation, and pointer arithmetic.

## üõ† Technologies Used
- Language: **C**
- OS: Unix-based (Tested on Ubuntu)
